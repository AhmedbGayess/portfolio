            "I've known Ahmed since the beginning of 2018 when he just started learning to code, and he was capable of learning programming and web development form scratch in less than a year. He's a proactive self-taught developer capable of building fully functioning web apps. I since then collaborated with him on some projects and I still plan on collaborating with him in the future.",
